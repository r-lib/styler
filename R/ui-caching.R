#' Clear the cache
#'
#' Clears the cache that stores which files are already styled. You won't be
#' able to undo this. Note that the file corresponding to the cache (a folder
#' on your file system) won't be deleted, but it will be empty after calling
#' `cache_clear`.
#' @param cache_name The name of the styler cache to use. If
#'   `NULL`, the option "styler.cache_name" is considered which defaults to
#'   the version of styler used.
#' @details
#' Each version of styler has its own cache by default, because styling is
#' potentially different with different versions of styler.
#' @param ask Whether or not to interactively ask the user again.
#' @family cache managers
#' @export
cache_clear <- function(cache_name = NULL, ask = TRUE) {

#' Remember the past to be quicker in the future
#'
#' Caching makes styler faster on repeated styling and is shared across all APIs
#' (e.g. `style_text()` and Addin).
#' That means if you style code that already complies to a
#' style guide and you have previously styled that code, it will be quicker.
#' @section Manage the cache:
#' See [cache_info()],[cache_activate()] or [cache_clear()] for utilities to
#' manage the cache. You can deactivate it altogether with [cache_deactivate()].
#' Since we leverage `{R.cache}` to manage the cache, you can also use any
#' `{R.cache}` functionality to manipulate it.
#'
#' In some cases, you want to use a non-standard cache location. In
#' that situation, you can set the path to the cache with the R option
#' `R.cache.rootPath` or the environment variable `R_CACHE_ROOTPATH` to an
#' existent path before you call the styler API.
#'
#' @section Invalidation:
#' The cache is specific to a version of styler by default, because different
#' versions potentially format code differently. This means after upgrading
#' styler or a style guide you use, the cache will be re-built.
#'
#' @section Mechanism and size:
#' The cache works by storing hashed output code as a whole and by expression,
#' which is why it takes zero space on disk (the cache is a directory with
#' empty files which have the hash of output code as name).
#'
#' @section Using a cache for styler in CI/CD:
#' If you want to set up caching in a CI/CD pipeline, we suggest to set the
#' `{R.cache}` root path to a directory for which you have the cache enabled.
#' This can often be set in config files of CI/CD tools, e.g. see the
#' [Travis documentation on caching](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching).

#' Show information about the styler cache
