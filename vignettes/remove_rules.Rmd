```{r, include = FALSE}

  collapse = TRUE,

)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
options(styler.colored_print.vertical = FALSE)
```

If you want to change the behavior of styler to match your desired style, there
are multiple ways:

-   Use the tidyverse style guide, but not with the default options. Starting
    point for this approach is the [help
    file](https://styler.r-lib.org/reference/tidyverse_style.html) for the
    function `tidyverse_style()`, which returns the transformer functions that
    prettify your code. Most of these options are explained in
    `vignette("styler")`.

-   If you can't get styler behaving the way you want using the arguments of
    `tidyverse_style()`, you have another option, which is described in a
    `vignette("customizing_styler")`: Creating your own style guide from
    scratch. Yes, I admit, it's pretty long and if you don't want to become a
    *styler expert*, it may be a little bit overwhelming.

-   If you don't care about how to create new rules but you simply want to
    *remove* a rule, I have good news for you: There is a quick way to do it.
    And that's what the remainder of this vignette focuses on.

Once you are happy with your style guide, you might want to have a look at how
to distribute it, which is described in
`vignette("distribute_custom_style_guides")`.

# Theory

Here are the steps required to deactivate a rule you don't like

-   Figure out which transformer function in the transformers returned by
    `tidyerse_style()` corresponds to the rule you want to remove.

-   Set that element in the list to `NULL`, which is equivalent to removing it.

-   Pass the list to `style_text` as a transformer.

# Practice

Lets assume you want to remove the rule that turns `=` into `<-` for
assignment. That means you want

    string = "hi there" 

to remain unchanged after applying styler. This is not the case if you use the
default style guide of styler:

```{r, comment = ""}
library(styler)
style_text("string = 'hi there'")
```

So you need to figure out which rule is responsible for this. Let's check the
transformer categories used with the tidyverse style guide.

```{r}
transformers <- tidyverse_style()
names(transformers)
```

From the aforementioned
[vignette](https://styler.r-lib.org/articles/customizing_styler.html):

> We note that there are different types of transformer functions. initialize
> initializes some variables in the nested parse table (so it is not actually a
> transformer), and the other elements modify either spacing, line breaks or
> tokens. use_raw_indention is not a function, it is just an option.

Now, we can look at the names of the rules that are sub-elements of the
transformer categories.

```{r}
library(magrittr)
levels <- c("space", "line_break", "indention", "token")
purrr::map(
  levels,
  ~ names(transformers[[.x]])
) %>%
  purrr::set_names(levels)
```

Spotted the rule we want to get rid of? It's under `token` and it's called
`force_assignment_op`. I agree, we could have chosen a better name. If you are
not sure if you can guess from the name of the rule what it does you can also
have a look at the function declaration of this (unexported) function.

```{r}
styler:::force_assignment_op
```

Next, you simply set that element to `NULL`.

```{r}
transformers$token$force_assignment_op <- NULL
```

And you can use the modified transformer list as input to `style_text()`

```{r}
style_text("string = 'hi there'", transformers = transformers)
```

If you want to use it the same way as `tidyverse_style()`, here's the last
step:

```{r}
eq_assign_style <- function(...) {
  transformers <- tidyverse_style(...)
  transformers$token$force_assignment_op <- NULL
  transformers
}

style_text("string = 'hi there'", style = eq_assign_style)
```

That's it. Note that the transformer functions and how they are returned by
`tidyverse_style()` is not part of the exposed API. This means that the order,
the naming etc. may change. Also, remember we did not add a rule to replace
`<-` with `=`, but we only removed a rule to replace `=` with `<-`, so `<-`
won't be touched:

```{r}
style_text("string <- 'hi there'", style = eq_assign_style)
```

If you want to turn `<-` into `=`, you need to add a rule as described in
`vignette("customizing_styler")`.

If you have trouble identifying a rule based on rule names,

-   First write an example whose results is not the one you wanted, e.g.

``` r
code <- "
f <- function () {

return (1)
}"
```

is code that will have the first empty line in the function body removed by
styler.

-   Then pinpoint the probable rule type (e.g. line breaks if you want less new
    lines).
-   In a local styler clone, add e.g. a `return(pd` at the top of the body to
    deactivate the rule quickly, or add a `print(pd)` or `browser()` call in
    the functions of that type (e.g. the different functions of
    `R/rules-line-breaks.R`), `load_all()`, run your example, see if that
    function made the change. move the `print(pd)` or `browser()` call to
    another function if not.
-   Once you've identified the culprit (in this case
    `style_line_break_around_curly`), set it to `NULL` as shown earlier.

# Some other rules and their transformers

-   You don't like multi-line ifelse statements getting wrapped around curly
    braces: `transformers$token$wrap_if_else_multi_line_in_curly`.

-   You don't like multi-line calls to be broken before the first named
    argument:
    `transformers$line_break$set_line_break_after_opening_if_call_is_multi_line`
    (interacting with
    `transformers$line_break$set_line_break_before_closing_call`).

-   You don't like the line being broken after the pipe:
    `transformers$line_break$add_line_break_after_pipe`

-   You don't like single quotes to be replaced by double quotes:
    `transformers$space$fix_quotes`.

-   You don't like comments to start with one space:
    `transformers$space$start_comments_with_space`

I think you get the idea. I nevertheless recommend using the [tidyverse style
guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) as is since

-   it is a well-established, thought-through style.

-   using a consistent style (no matter which) reduces friction in the
    community.
