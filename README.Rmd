A collection of git pre-commit hooks to use with
[pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com). Currently, we have:

* `style-files`: A hook to style files with [styler](https://styler.r-lib.org).
  Only commit code corresponding to the tidyverse style guide. NOTE: devel
  version of styler strongly suggested. Install via
  `remotes::install_github('r-lib/styler')`. To customize, see *Hooks arguments* 
  below.

* `readme-rmd-rendered`: Make sure `README.Rmd` hasn't been edited more recently
  than `README.md`, i.e. remind you to render the `.Rmd` to `.md` before
  committing.

* `parsable-R`: Checks if your `.R` files are "valid" R code.

* `no-browser-statement`: Guarantees you that you don't accidentally commit code
  with a `browser()` statement in it.
  
* `spell-check`: Checks spelling with `spelling::spell_check_files()`. Excluded
  are R and python scrips as well as .gitignore. To customize, 
  see *Hooks arguments* below.

* `roxygenize`: A hook to run `roxygen2::roxygenize()`. Makes sure you commit
  your `.Rd` changes with the source changes.

* `use-tidy-description`: A hook to run `usethis::use_tidy_description()` to
  ensure dependencies are ordered alphabetically and fields are in standard
  order.

To add a pre-commit hook to your project, install pre-commit as described in the
[official documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#intro) and make sure the
executable `pre-commit` is in a place that is on your `$PATH`.

If you installed pre-commit, you can add it to a specific project by adding a
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` file that has a structure like this:

``` yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v0.0.0.9008
    hooks: 
    -   id: style-files
    -   id: parsable-R
    -   id: no-browser-statement
    -   id: readme-rmd-rendered
    -   id: roxygenize
    -   id: use-tidy-description
```
The `repo` key points to the place where the source code of the hooks are stored, 
not the repo you want to apply them to.

Some hooks also take arguments, see section **Arguments** below.

If you want to see the file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in RStudio, you have to
enable "Show Hidden Files" in the *Files* Pane of RStudio under *More*.

Next, run `pre-commit install` in your repo and you are done. The next time you
run `git commit`, the hooks listed in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` will get
executed before the commit. When any file is changed due to running a hook, the
commit will fail. **Do not abort while hooks are running.** Non-staged changes
are stashed to a temp directory when the hooks are run and may not easily be
recovered afterwards. You can inspect the changes introduced by the hook and if
satisfied, you can attempt to commit again. If all hooks pass, the commit is
made. You can also [temporarily disable
hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#temporarily-disabling-hooks). If you succeed, it
should look like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figs/screenshot.png")
```

You can also add other hooks from other repos, by extending the
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` file, e.g. like this:

```yaml
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v1.2.3
    hooks: 
    -   id: check-added-large-files
````

To update the hook revisions, just run `pre-commit autoupdate`.

# why using hooks?

The goal of pre-commit hooks is to improve the quality of commits. This is
achieved by making sure your commits meet some (formal) requirements, e.g:

- that they comply to a certain coding style (with the hook `style-files`).

- that you commit derivatives such as `README.md` or `.Rd` files with their
  source instead of spreading them over multiple commits.

- and so on.

As all changes enter a repository history with a commit, we believe many checks
should be performed at that point, and not only later on a CI service. For
example, creating auto-commits at a CI service for styling code creates
unnecessary extra commits, as styling can be checked at the time of committing
and is relatively inexpensive.

# why using the pre-commit framework?

Implementing hooks in a framework such as
[pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com) has multiple benefits compared to use
simple bash scripts in `.git/hooks`:

* easily use hooks other people wrote, in bash, R, python and other languages.
  There is a wealth of useful hooks available, most listed
  [here](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html). For example,
  `check-added-large-files` prevents you from committing big files, other hooks
  validate json or yaml files and so on.

* No need to worry about dependencies, testing, different versions of hooks,
  file filtering for specific hooks etc. It's handled by pre-commit.

* Hooks are maintained in *one* place, and you just need a
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. No need to c/p hooks from one project to
  another.

# Hook arguments

Arguments are specified as described in the
[pre-commit.com documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#passing-arguments-to-hooks), 
that is, as children in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. The following hooks 
take arguments:

* `style-files`: Argument `style_pkg` and `style_fun` if you want to use another 
  style guide than the default. The below example styles code according to the 
  [one-line-style](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/oneliner):
  `args: [style_pkg=oneliner, style_fun=one_line_style]`.

* `spell-check`: Argument `ignore_files` takes a regular expression matched with 
  `base::grep()` to ignore furhter files from the hook. Argument `lang` is passed
  to `spelling::spell_check_files()`.
