run_test_impl(
  path_executable,
  path_candidate,
  std_err,
  std_out,
  cmd_args,
  artifacts,
  file_transformer,
  env,
  expect_success
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_executable}{The path to the executable bash script.}

\item{path_candidate}{The path to a file that should be modified by the
executable.}

\item{std_err}{An expected error message. If no error is expected, this
can be \code{NULL}. In that case, the \code{comparator} is applied.}

\item{std_out}{The expected stdout message. If \code{NULL}, this check is omitted.}

\item{cmd_args}{More arguments passed to the file. Pre-commit handles it as
described \href{https://pre-commit.com/#arguments-pattern-in-hooks}{here}.}

\item{artifacts}{Path with artifact files to copy to the temp directory root where
the test is run. If you don't target the root, this can be a named vector
of length one where the name is the target location relative to the
temporary location and the value is the source of the file.}

\item{env}{The environment variables to set with \code{\link[base:system2]{base::system2()}}.}

\item{expect_success}{Whether or not an exit code 0 is expected. This can
be derived from \code{std_err}, but sometimes, non-empty stderr does not mean
error, but just a message.}
