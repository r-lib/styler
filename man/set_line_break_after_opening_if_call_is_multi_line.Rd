set_line_break_after_opening_if_call_is_multi_line(
  pd,
  except_token_after = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{pd}{The parse table.}

\item{except_token_after}{The tokens after the token that cause an exception.}

\item{except_text_before}{A character vector with text before a token that
does not cause a line break.}

\item{force_text_before}{A character vector with text before "'('" that

\description{
Sets line break after opening parenthesis
}
\details{
In general, every call that is multi-line has a line break after the opening
parenthesis. Exceptions:
\itemize{
\item The token right after the parenthesis is a comment, then, the line should
be broken after the comment only. Governed by \code{except_token_after}.
\item The name of the function called is \code{ifelse()} or similar, where we can
allow the condition on the same line as the function name, and we don't
impose rules on the line breaks for the subsequent arguments. Governed
by \code{except_text_before}.
\item Some calls like \code{switch()} statements are always forced to become multi-
line. Governed by \code{force_text_before}.
